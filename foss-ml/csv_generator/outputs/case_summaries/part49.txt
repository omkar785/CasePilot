Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It seems to be a legal judgment related to corporate law, specifically dealing with the jurisdiction of certain courts and tribunals under the Companies Act. 

The case mentions the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). It talks about the exclusive jurisdiction under Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, and how the civil court's jurisdiction is impliedly barred in such cases. There's also a reference to Section 59 of the Companies Act, 2013, which vests power with the NCLT. 

The judgment discusses issues like forged documents, rectification proceedings, and the role of SEBI. It seems the court remanded the matter back to the High Court for reconsideration. The case also involves disputes over share certificates and payments, indicating a corporate governance issue.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let me break it down step by step.

1. **Case Type**: The general domain is Corporate. The specific category is Corporate Governance Disputes because it involves issues related to company management and legal proceedings.

2. **Legal Provisions & Charges**: The relevant sections are Section 155 of the Companies Act, 1956, and Section 59 of the Companies Act, 2013. Additionally, Section 111-A of the 1956 Act and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 1992, are mentioned.

3. **Parties Involved**: The parties are likely a mix of individuals (appellants) and possibly a large corporation (respondent). The case involves a regulatory authority, SEBI, as the court discusses their jurisdiction.

4. **Judgment & Legal Reasoning**: The court allowed the appeals, remanding the matter to the High Court. The reasoning was that the NCLAT overlooked key issues and documentary evidence, and the jurisdictional aspects under the Companies Act needed re-examination.

5. **Claims, Settlements & Fines**: There's no mention of fines or settlements, so this section would state that no financial penalties were imposed.

I need to ensure that each section is concise and accurately reflects the context provided. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and structured as per the example given.
