Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. The context is a judgment from the Supreme Court of India, specifically from the case 262 [2024] 9 S.C.R. It's about anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). The case involves an appellant and respondents, with the appellant arguing about the applicability of anticipatory bail when the person is already in custody for another case.

First, I need to determine the case type. The case is related to criminal law because it deals with bail and criminal procedure. The specific category would be related to bail and arrest procedures, so maybe "Bail and Arrest Procedures" under the broader criminal category.

Next, the legal provisions involved are primarily Section 438 of the CrPC. The judgment also references the Anwar Ali Sarkar case, which is a constitutional case about the right to a fair trial, so Article 21 of the Constitution is relevant here as well. Additionally, the court mentions Section 18A of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, which excludes the application of Section 438 in certain cases.

The parties involved are an individual appellant and respondents, which could be either individuals or a public institution. Since the case is about bail, the respondents might be the state or a public authority prosecuting the appellant.

The judgment outcome is that the appellant's argument was rejected. The court held that anticipatory bail cannot be granted if the person is already in custody for another offense. The reasoning was based on the right to equality under Articles 14 and 19, and the right to a fair trial under Article 21. The court emphasized that granting anticipatory bail in such circumstances would create a two-tier system, violating the principles of equality and fairness.

There were no fines or compensations involved since the case was about bail eligibility, not financial penalties. The court's decision was about the legal principles rather than monetary outcomes.

Putting it all together, the case summary should reflect these elements clearly and concisely.
