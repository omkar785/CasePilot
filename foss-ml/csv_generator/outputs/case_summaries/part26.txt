Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is Mohammed Enterprises (Tanzania) Ltd. v. Farooq Ali Khan & Ors. It's a civil appeal, specifically Civil Appeal No. 48 of 2025, decided on January 3, 2025, by Justices Pamidighantam Sri Narasimha and Manoj Misra.

First, I need to determine the case type. The context mentions the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, and talks about CIRP (Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process). So, the general legal domain is Corporate, and the specific category is Bankruptcy & Insolvency.

Next, the legal provisions involved are the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, specifically section 60(5)(c). There are also references to other cases, but the main statute is the IBC.

The parties involved are Mohammed Enterprises (Tanzania) Ltd., which is a corporate entity, and Farooq Ali Khan & Ors., who are individuals. The case is between a corporate entity and individuals, likely creditors or stakeholders.

The judgment is that the High Court was not justified in interdicting the CIRP proceedings. The Supreme Court held that the High Court overstepped its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. The reasoning includes that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is a complete code with its own checks and balances, and the High Court shouldn't interfere without sufficient cause. They also mentioned the delay in approaching the court and the existing appeal mechanisms under the IBC.

There's no mention of any fines, settlements, or compensation in the context, so that section remains empty.

Putting it all together, the case summary should reflect that the High Court's interference was deemed improper, emphasizing the self-contained nature of the IBC and the need for judicial restraint.
