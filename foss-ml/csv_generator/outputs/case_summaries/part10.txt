Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It's about criminal proceedings against two individuals, M (Mathew) and R (Ramesh). The court restored the proceedings against Mathew but quashed those against Ramesh. 

First, I'll determine the case type. The context mentions criminal proceedings, so the general domain is Criminal. The specific category would be Financial Crimes since it involves unauthorized procurement of railway tickets, which seems like a financial offense.

Next, the legal provisions. The case cites Section 143 of the Act, which I assume is the Indian Penal Code or another relevant statute. The judgment discusses statutory interpretation, so I should include that as well.

For the parties involved, Mathew is an individual accused of unauthorized ticketing, and Ramesh is an authorized agent. The prosecution is likely the government or a regulatory authority.

The judgment outcome is that Mathew's case is restored, and Ramesh's is quashed. The reasoning includes the interpretation of Section 143, the principle that clear statutes should be enforced as written, and the distinction between authorized and unauthorized agents.

There's no mention of fines or settlements, so that section remains empty.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary with each section filled appropriately, ensuring clarity and conciseness.
