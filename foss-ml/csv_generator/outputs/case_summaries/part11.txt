Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is Geetha V.M. & Ors. v. Rethnasenan K. & Ors., decided by the Supreme Court of India. It's under civil appellate jurisdiction, specifically Civil Appeal Nos. 3994-3997 of 2024. The High Court of Kerala at Ernakulam had passed an order on 13.03.2019 in certain Writ Appeals, which were then appealed to the Supreme Court.

Looking at the context, the case involves employees who were transferred from the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) to the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) due to the abolition of a dual control system. The main issue is about inter-se seniority between the original DME employees and the absorbed DHS employees.

The legal provisions mentioned include the Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules, 1958, and the Kerala Service Rules (KSR), 1959. The court cited cases like State of Punjab v. Ram Singh and Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab, which dealt with seniority and absorption of employees.

The parties involved are government employees (appellants) and the State of Kerala (respondents). The judgment was delivered by Justice J.K. Maheshwari, and the court upheld the High Court's order regarding seniority rights.

There's no mention of fines or compensation, so the claims and settlements section remains empty.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. I'll start with the case type, which is Labor, specifically Workplace Disputes. The legal provisions are the Kerala Service Rules. The parties are individuals (employees) and a government entity. The judgment upholds the order, and there's no financial penalty mentioned.

I should ensure each section is concise and accurately reflects the context. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.
