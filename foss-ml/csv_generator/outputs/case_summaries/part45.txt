Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. The case is about a petition seeking the cancellation of existing licenses and prohibition on issuing new licenses for the export of arms and military equipment by Indian companies. The court discussed the implications of such a move, including potential breaches of international contracts and the financial viability of Indian companies. They also mentioned that the Union Government has the authority under certain acts to impose prohibitions.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the Case Type. The general legal domain here seems to be Constitutional because it involves a petition under Article 32, which is related to fundamental rights. The specific case category would be Judicial Review Cases since the court is reviewing the government's actions or inactions.

Next, Legal Provisions & Charges. The context lists the Constitution of India, Foreign Trade (Regulation and Development Act), and Customs Act, 1962. So, I should mention these as the relevant statutes.

For the Parties Involved, the petitioners are individuals (Ashok Kumar Sharma & Ors), and the respondent is the Union of India, which is a government entity.

Judgment & Legal Reasoning: The court dismissed the petition. The reasoning was that the court shouldn't interfere in matters of foreign policy and international relations, as that's the domain of the executive (Union Government). They cited the potential negative consequences of judicial intervention, such as affecting international contracts and the financial health of companies. They also noted that the Union Government has the statutory power to handle such issues under the mentioned acts.

Claims, Settlements & Fines: There were no fines or compensations awarded because the court dismissed the relief sought.

Putting it all together, I need to make sure each section is concise and accurately reflects the context provided. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.
