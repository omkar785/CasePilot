Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is Sadashiv Dhondiram Patil v. The State of Maharashtra, decided in 2025. It's a criminal case involving murder. The appellant was accused of murdering his wife using an iron rod. The prosecution relied on circumstantial evidence, including various panchnamas (which are documents prepared in the presence of witnesses), post-mortem reports, and photographs.

The trial court initially acquitted the appellant, but the High Court reversed this decision, convicting him of murder and sentencing him to life imprisonment. The case was then taken to the Supreme Court, which upheld the High Court's judgment.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let's break it down section by section.

1. **Case Type**: The general domain is Criminal. The specific category is Homicide/Murder.

2. **Legal Provisions & Charges**: The relevant sections include Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for murder, Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for the accused's statement, and Sections 25 and 27 of the Indian Evidence Act regarding the admissibility of evidence.

3. **Parties Involved**: The appellant is an individual, and the respondent is the State of Maharashtra, which is a government entity.

4. **Judgment & Legal Reasoning**: The High Court found the appellant guilty based on circumstantial evidence, including the discovery of the iron rod and the appellant's statement. The Supreme Court upheld this decision, emphasizing the reliance on circumstantial evidence and the credibility of the prosecution's case.

5. **Claims, Settlements & Fines**: The appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. There's no mention of fines or compensation, so I'll note that no financial penalties were imposed.

I should ensure each section is concise and accurately reflects the information from the context. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.
