Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It's a Supreme Court case, Civil Appeal No. 2669 of 2013, decided on December 11, 2023. The case revolves around limitation periods in legal proceedings, specifically regarding the determination of mesne profits under the Code of Civil Procedure (C.P.C.).

The case type is Civil, specifically a Property Dispute. The legal provisions involved are the Limitation Act, the Code of Civil Procedure (C.P.C.), particularly Order XX Rule 12 and Section 141. The parties involved are individuals, as the respondents are seeking mesne profits, and the petitioners are opposing it.

The judgment states that when no limitation is prescribed, the court must assess if the delay is reasonable. The court held that the application for mesne profits was not barred by limitation because it was a continuation of the original suit, not a fresh proceeding. The court dismissed the petitioners' contention that the application was barred by limitation.

There are no fines or compensations mentioned, so that section remains empty.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. I'll make sure each section is filled accurately based on the context provided. I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.
