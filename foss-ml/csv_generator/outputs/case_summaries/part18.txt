Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It seems to be a legal case involving property disputes, specifically about the sale of certain properties and the rights of the parties involved. The case mentions a compromise decree, a sale deed, and the application of the 'Doctrine of Relation Back' which influenced the court's decision.

First, I'll identify the case type. The context talks about property rights, sale deeds, and partition suits, so it's definitely a Civil case, specifically a Property Dispute.

Next, the legal provisions and charges. The context cites the 'Doctrine of Relation Back' and refers to specific cases like Kasabai Tukaram Karvar’s case and Sripad Gajanan Suthankar’s case. These are likely relevant precedents. I should note these as the legal provisions.

For the parties involved, the plaintiff is an individual, and the defendants include both individuals and possibly others. The case seems to involve private entities, so I'll note that it's between private parties.

The judgment and legal reasoning: The court dismissed the plaintiff's appeal, holding that the sale was valid under the compromise decree and the doctrine. The reasoning was based on the cumulative effect of the compromise and the sale deed, as well as the precedents mentioned.

Claims, settlements, and fines: There's no mention of fines or damages, so I'll state that no financial penalties were imposed.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the summary accordingly, making sure each section is concise and accurate based on the context provided.
