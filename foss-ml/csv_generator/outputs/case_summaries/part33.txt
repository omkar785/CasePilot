Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context thoroughly.

The case involves two parties: M/s Vaibhav Motors, the appellant and a dealer, and M/s Hindustan Motors, the manufacturer. The issue revolves around liability for compensation after an accident involving a vehicle. Hindustan Motors tried to shift the liability to the dealer using certain clauses in their agreement, but the court rejected this argument. The court held that Hindustan Motors was jointly and severally liable because the vehicle was still under their ownership and control at the time of the accident, as their employees were involved in the test drive.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let me go through each section one by one.

1. **Case Type**: The general domain here seems to be Civil, as it's a dispute between two businesses over liability. The specific category would be Tort Claims (Personal Injury & Negligence) because it involves compensation for an accident.

2. **Legal Provisions & Charges**: From the context, the relevant acts are the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, and the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. These would be cited here.

3. **Parties Involved**: Both parties are large corporations. The case is between private entities, specifically between a dealer and a manufacturer.

4. **Judgment & Legal Reasoning**: The court held Hindustan Motors liable. The reasoning was that the clauses in the agreement only limited liability under warranty, not tortious liability. The vehicle was under Hindustan's ownership and control since their employees were using it, so the dealer wasn't liable.

5. **Claims, Settlements & Fines**: The compensation was awarded against Hindustan Motors, but the exact amount isn't specified in the context. The legal provisions under which this was awarded would be the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.

I need to make sure each section is concise and accurately reflects the context. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and straightforward.
