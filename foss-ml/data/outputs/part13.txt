Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It seems to be about a case involving the Stamp Act, specifically Section 47(A)(10). The case involves an appeal where the High Court allowed the appeals and quashed the orders passed by lower authorities. The issue revolves around the Registering Officer referring documents for market value determination without proper reasons, which the court found illegal.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Case Type**: The general domain here is Tax, and the specific category is Corporate Tax Litigation because it involves disputes over tax matters, likely between a company and the government.

2. **Legal Provisions & Charges**: The relevant sections are the Stamp Act, specifically Section 47(A)(10). The charges relate to improper procedures in referring documents for market value determination without adequate reasons.

3. **Parties Involved**: The parties are the Appellants (likely individuals or corporations) and the Government (Registering Officer and Inspector General of Registration). It's a case between private entities (appellants) and a public institution (government).

4. **Judgment & Legal Reasoning**: The High Court allowed the appeals, quashing the lower court orders. The reasoning was that the Registering Officer didn't follow the proper procedure, didn't record reasons for undervaluation, and lacked material to support the reference. Precedents like Mohali Club v. State of Punjab were cited, emphasizing the need for a prima facie basis for undervaluation.

5. **Claims, Settlements & Fines**: There's no mention of fines or compensation, so this section would state that none were imposed.

I need to make sure each section is concise and accurately reflects the context. I should avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and structured as per the example provided.
