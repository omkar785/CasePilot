Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the context. It's about a case involving the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and some officials. The case seems to be related to corruption, specifically illegal gratification and processing of bills. The court's judgment is mentioned, and it talks about the CBI's jurisdiction and whether prior sanctions were required.

First, I need to figure out the case type. The context mentions the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, which is related to corruption and bribery. So, the general legal domain is Criminal, and the specific category is Financial Crimes (Fraud & Embezzlement).

Next, the legal provisions involved. The main act is the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, specifically Section 7. There's also mention of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, Sections 2 and 3, which relate to the CBI's jurisdiction. Additionally, the judgment refers to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 197, regarding prior sanctions for prosecuting public servants.

Now, the parties involved. The complainant is an individual, Sri C. Dorrai Rajulu Naidu. The accused is a Senior Divisional Financial Manager, which is a public servant. The CBI is the investigating agency, and the court involved is the High Court and the Supreme Court.

The judgment outcome is that the High Court quashed the FIRs and chargesheets, and the Supreme Court upheld this decision. The reasoning was that the CBI didn't have jurisdiction without prior sanctions from the State of Bihar, as required by law.

Regarding claims, settlements, or fines, the context doesn't mention any specific fines or compensation. It's more about the jurisdictional issue and the dismissal of the FIRs.

Putting it all together, I need to structure this into the specified format, making sure each section is concise and accurate based on the context provided.
