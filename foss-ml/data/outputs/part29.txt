Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is Jit Vinayak Arolkar v. State of Goa & Ors. It's a criminal appeal, specifically Criminal Appeal No. 393 of 2024, decided on 06 January 2025 by Justices Abhay S. Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan. The appellant is Jit Vinayak Arolkar, and the respondents are the State of Goa and others.

The issue revolves around a First Information Report (FIR) registered under Section 420 of the IPC, which deals with cheating. The 4th respondent filed twelve civil suits in 2018 claiming ownership of a property. Then, in 2020, he filed a complaint alleging that the appellant sold part of the property without consent, leading to the FIR. The appellant challenged this, arguing that the complaint was filed two years after the civil suits, and the respondent suppressed the fact that civil suits were already in progress. The court found that the FIR was an abuse of legal process because the respondent waited too long and didn't disclose the existing civil cases.

The court relied on Section 420 of the IPC but noted that the elements of cheating under Section 415 weren't established. They dismissed the FIR and quashed the proceedings against the appellant.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format. Let me go through each section step by step.

1. **Case Type**: The domain is Criminal, and the specific category is Financial Crimes (Fraud & Embezzlement) because it involves cheating under IPC sections.

2. **Legal Provisions & Charges**: The relevant sections are IPC 415 and 420. The charge was under Section 420, but the court found Section 415 wasn't made out.

3. **Parties Involved**: The appellant is an individual, and the respondents include the State and others, likely private parties. The case is between private entities and the State.

4. **Judgment & Legal Reasoning**: The judgment was that the FIR was quashed. The reasoning was that the complaint was filed after a delay, and the respondent didn't disclose the civil suits, leading to an abuse of process. Precedents like Mohd. Ibrahim v. State of Bihar were relied upon.

5. **Claims, Settlements & Fines**: There were no fines or compensation; the FIR was dismissed.

I need to ensure each section is concise and accurately reflects the context. I should avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.
