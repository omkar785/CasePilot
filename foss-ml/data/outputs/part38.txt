Okay, so I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is Mandakini Diwan and Anr. v. The High Court of Chhattisgarh & Ors., decided in 2024. It's a criminal case, specifically under the category of Fundamental Rights Violations because it involves the right to a fair investigation.

The legal provisions involved are the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, and the Constitution of India. The parties involved are individuals (the appellants) and a government entity (the High Court of Chhattisgarh and others).

The judgment allowed the appeal, directing the CBI to investigate. The reasoning was that the appellants had credible allegations of bias and undue influence by a senior judicial officer, necessitating an independent investigation to ensure fairness and uphold their fundamental rights.

There were no fines or compensations mentioned, so that section remains empty.

I need to structure this into the specified format, making sure each section is concise and accurate.
