Okay, I need to provide a structured legal case summary based on the given context. Let me start by understanding the case details.

The case is about a suit for specific performance of an agreement to sell property. The respondents sued the appellants, who are the predecessors in interest, for not executing the sale deed despite receiving earnest money. The trial court partially decreed the suit, directing the appellants to refund the earnest money with interest. The respondents appealed, and the appellate court allowed the appeal, directing the appellants to execute the sale deed upon payment of the balance.

Now, I need to structure this into the specified format.

Case Type: The general domain is Civil, and the specific category is Property Disputes.

Legal Provisions & Charges: The case involves the Specific Relief Act, 1963, specifically section 28, which deals with rescission of contracts for the sale or lease of immovable property. The court discussed the jurisdiction of the execution court under section 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

Parties Involved: Both parties are individuals. The respondents are suing the appellants, who are private individuals.

Judgment & Legal Reasoning: The appellate court allowed the appeal, directing the appellants to execute the sale deed. The reasoning was based on the Specific Relief Act, emphasizing that the execution court must transfer the application to the original suit's file before deciding it. The court rejected the jurisdictional objection, affirming that the execution court could handle the application under section 28.

Claims, Settlements & Fines: The respondents claimed specific performance, which was granted. The appellants were ordered to refund the earnest money with interest, as per the trial court's decree.

I think that covers all the necessary points. I'll structure this into the specified sections, ensuring each part is concise and accurate.
